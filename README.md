# Code complexity analysis

> The original source code is in `original.js` and the enhancement is in `main.js`

## Complexity analysis of original code

### 1. Spatial complexity

> The compexity of this code is **`O(1)`**, that is ***constant***, as it does not use dynamic data structures such as arrays.

### 2. Time Complexity

> The overall time complexity of the code is generally ***constant*** **`O(1)`** for rice cooker functions

### 3. Analysis of the number of operations

> This part can be found directly in the code

## Complexity analysis of modified code

### 1. Spatial complexity

> **`O(1)`**

### 2. Time Complexity

> **`O(1)`**

### 3. Analysis of the number of operations

> This part can be found directly in the code
